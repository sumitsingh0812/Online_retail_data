Online Retail data 

This repository showcases a data analysis project where I utilized Python, SQL, and Power BI to analyze a retail dataset. The dataset includes details such as InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, and Country.

The project involved several stages: first, I cleaned the data by handling null values, dropping missing data, and removing outliers. I then answered key questions relevant to business insights using Python, focusing on areas that could potentially interest decision-makers. The analysis was supported by data visualizations created using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, which helped uncover patterns and trends within the dataset.

Next, I used SQL to analyze the same dataset in more detail, refining my questions and performing deeper queries. Finally, I created an interactive dashboard using Power BI, offering a visual representation of key metrics and insights that could be easily interpreted by stakeholders.

This dataset was obtained when I attended webinars on Power BI, and the project served as a practical exercise to apply the skills I gained during those sessions.
